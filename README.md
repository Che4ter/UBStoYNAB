# UBS Switzerland to YNAB
This small tool automatically tries to export all transactions from the available bank and credit card accounts into a.csv, which can be easily imported into YNAB. 

If necessary, the export function must be adapted to your own YNAB structure so that the transaction categories can be set automatically.

The UBS Access Card is required for export to access the UBS account.

## Usage
Create a config.json file, similar to the config.demo.json which contains your UBS contract number.
